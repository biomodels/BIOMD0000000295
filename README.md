**Abstract:**   
A striking and defining feature of circadian clocks is the small variation in
period over a physiological range of temperatures. This is referred to as
temperature compensation, although recent work has suggested that the
variation observed is a specific, adaptive control of period. Moreover, given
that many biological rate constants have a Q(10) of around 2, it is remarkable
that such clocks remain rhythmic under significant temperature changes. We
introduce a new mathematical model for the Neurospora crassa circadian network
incorporating experimental work showing that temperature alters the balance of
translation between a short and long form of the FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein. This
is used to discuss period control and functionality for the Neurospora system.
The model reproduces a broad range of key experimental data on temperature
dependence and rhythmicity, both in wild-type and mutant strains. We present a
simple mechanism utilising the presence of the FRQ isoforms (isoform
switching) by which period control could have evolved, and argue that this
regulatory structure may also increase the temperature range where the clock
is robustly rhythmic.
